          Whether you're hosting a wedding, a birthday or simply a live event at
          a bar, caf√© or pub, you want someone who can cater for all ages.

          You can choose your own playlist from my extensive and ever growing
          repertoire. You can suggest favourites for me to bring my own unique
          style to. From folk, indie, Rock and Pop such as the Beatles, the
          Animals, Spandau Ballet or the Killers. From Yazoo to Coldplay and
          Neil Young. I can even bring a drum-machine and a looper pedal to
          create a one-man-band!
