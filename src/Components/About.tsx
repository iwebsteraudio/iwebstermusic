        I'm a singer, a songwriter, a guitarist and a bass player. I produce
        library music and play live shows.
      </p>
      <p className="p-3">
        I moved out from Middlesbrough in 2010 with a dream to let my bass-playing take me on a journey.&nbsp;
        Since moving, I've learned to sing, I learned to produce music at Salford University, which I've continued to learn since. &nbsp;
        I've worked in kitchens, in offices, on sound-stages in woods. I learned to code, even. I coded this website.
      </p>
      <p className="p-3"> My dream is to play weddings, events and bars. To entertain crowds and have them sing along. To bring the party&nbsp;
       and give people a special night.
      </p>
